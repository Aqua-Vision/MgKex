The following values are meaningful to Windows 7 when under the IFEO root:

DevOverrideEnabled
  Allows .local redirection for all .exes.

The following values are meaningful to Windows 7 when under an IFEO exe key:

== kernel32!CreateProcessInternalW ==

Debugger

== kernel32!BaseDllInitialize ==

SearchPathMode - passed directly to SetSearchPathMode() on dll init

== ntdll!RtlpProcessIFEOKeyFilter ==

FilterFullPath
UseFilter

== ntdll!LdrpInitializeExecutionOptions ==

GlobalFlag(*)
  This value ends up in Peb->NtGlobalFlag.
  See FLG_* in NtDll.h

CWDIllegalInDllSearch
DisableHeapLookaside

ShutdownFlags
  This value is checked by ntdll!RtlDetectHeapLeaks upon proper process
  shutdown (i.e. not terminated forcibly).
  Possible values are a combination of INSPECT_LEAKS and BREAK_ON_LEAKS
  defined in NtDll.h.

MinimumStackCommitInBytes
MaxDeadActivationContexts
UnloadEventTraceDepth
TracingFlags

ShowRecursiveDllLoads
BreakOnRecursiveDllLoads

== ntdll!LdrpInitializeApplicationVerifierPackage ==

PageHeapFlags(*)

VerifierFlags(*)
HandleTraces(*)

VerifierDebug(*)
  Various flags which control debug printing.

(*) - Any value thus marked is able to be read from HKCU ifeo key
(HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options)
in addition to the normal one in HKLM, but ONLY if SharedUserData->ImageFileExecutionOptions
has the low-order bit set to 1.

The Microsoft documentation for the verifier.dll function "VerifierIsPerUserSettingsEnabled"
says that we should set a DWORD registry value "ImageExecutionOptions" in the registry key
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager to 1, and then the kernel
will set the appropriate value in SharedUserData.

Usually this would be a good thing for VxKex because we wouldn't have to ask for admin
permissions to change configs, but unfortunately the AVrfOpenCurrentUserImageFileOptionsKey
routine in ntdll doesn't respect the "IFEO key filter" mechanism implemented in
RtlpProcessIFEOKeyFilter. Therefore all of our configuration must be stored in the HKLM
ifeo key.
