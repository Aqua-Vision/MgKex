This file details all the application-specific compatibility workarounds contained in VxKex.
If you add a new workaround, you MUST document it and its reason for existence in this file.
Otherwise, the hacks will accumulate and become unmaintainable.
Furthermore, in the source code, you must include a comment with the word "APPSPECIFICHACK"
in it, to facilitate textual search and location of these compatibility workarounds. As
soon as VxKex contains sufficient functionality to no longer require a hack it should be
removed.

Application Name:		Autodesk Maya
Executable Name:		MAYA.EXE, MAYABATCH.EXE
Executable Version:		all
Architecture:			x86 and x64
Added Version:			0.0.0.2
Removed Version:		N/A
Description:
	In VXKEXLDR.EXE, the user-friendly bitness mismatch error box is disabled because the
	Autodesk licensing executable AdskLicensingAgent.exe is a 32-bit executable
	intentionally loaded into the 64-bit application, and is not actually an error.

Application Name:		OneDrive Installer
Executable Name:		ONEDRIVESETUP.EXE
Executable Version:		all
Architecture:			x86 and x64
Added Version:			0.0.0.2
Removed Version:		N/A
Description:
	In VXKEXLDR.EXE, the Windows version spoof functionality is disabled because this
	setup application checks the Windows version and calls extra incompatible APIs (which
	will cause a crash) if it is higher than Windows 7.
	In KERNEL33.DLL, the function VerifyVersionInfoW will always return TRUE, since the
	setup application will call this specific function to display its error dialog.

Application Name:		KeyMouse
Executable Name:		KEYMOUSE.EXE
Executable Version:		all
Architecture:			x86 and x64
Added Version:			0.0.0.1
Removed Version:		N/A
Description:
	In USER33.DLL, the function SetWindowsHookExW is disabled, because the hooks that
	KeyMouse installs cause Explorer to crash on Windows 7. Disabling hooks for this
	application has no severe detrimental effects, AFAICT.
